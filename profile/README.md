# What is Vulnebify?

Vulnebify applies geopolitical threat intelligence, shaped by frontline cyber warfare experience in Ukraine, to help organizations and countries detect, validate, and act on real cyber threats.

We provide safe, low-noise tools and APIs to continuously check domains, IPs, and infrastructure, revealing exposed services, misconfigurations, and risky assets exactly as they appear on the public Internet.

Built for threat intelligence teams, red teams, blue teams, and security-focused developers.

If it’s online, it’s already being profiled.
