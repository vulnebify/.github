‚úÖ Safe, low-noise scanning

‚úÖ CLI and API integration

‚úÖ No noise. No spam. Just visibility.

# üåê Know what you‚Äôre exposing

Every day, thousands of misconfigured services are left open to the Internet, often unknowingly.

**Exposure of the day:** One of tens of thousands of exposed Ollama (AI) servers



In this short demo, we discover a publicly accessible Ollama server on the Internet and connect to it. 

No authentication, no firewall, full model access.

> This server was found during a passive scan of exposed Ollama instances.  
> It had no authentication and allowed anyone to connect and run LLM queries.  
> We anonymized all identifying information for responsible disclosure.

üö® If it's on the Internet, it's already being scanned. Often by bad actors.
