# 🛡️ What is Vulnebify?

Vulnebify is a Ukraine-based cybersecurity company focused on one mission: **to help organizations discover and monitor their public attack surface before attackers do.**

We provide tools and APIs to scan domains, IPs, and infrastructure revealing misconfigurations, exposed services, and risky assets in real time.

Whether you're a red teamer, blue teamer, or just security-conscious, Vulnebify gives you a fast, ethical, and developer-friendly way to see what the Internet sees.

⚔️ Battle-tested. Built from the front lines of real-world Internet exposure.

# 🌐 Know what you’re exposing

Every day, thousands of misconfigured services are left open to the Internet, often unknowingly.

**Exposure of the day:** One of tens of thousands of exposed Ollama (AI) servers

In this short demo, we discover a publicly accessible Ollama server on the Internet and connect to it. No authentication, no firewall, full model access.

> This server was identified using publicly accessible data and standard OSINT techniques via **Vulnebify**.  
> No authentication was bypassed, no systems were exploited, and no private content was accessed.  
>  
> The disclosure aligns with international humanitarian law *(Hague Regulations, Art. 24; Geneva Protocol I, Art. 57)*,  
> which permits and encourages reconnaissance and transparency regarding hostile infrastructure during armed conflict.

🚨 If it's on the Internet, it's already being scanned. Often by bad actors.
