# What is Vulnebify?

Vulnebify helps organizations discover and monitor their public attack surface before attackers do.

We provide safe, low-noise tools and APIs to scan domains, IPs, and infrastructure for exposed services, misconfigurations, and risky assets—exactly as the Internet sees them.

Built for red teams, blue teams, and security-focused developers.

If it’s online, it’s already being scanned.
