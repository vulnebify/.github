# What is Vulnebify?

**Vulnebify** applies geopolitical threat intelligence to help organizations and countries detect, validate, and act on real cyber threats shaped by cyber warfare experience in Ukraine.

The platform discovers external infrastructure, deploys decoy replicas in high-risk regions, and alerts teams to relevant validated threats.

Built for threat intelligence teams, red and blue teams, and security-focused developers in highly regulated environments, Vulnebify helps reduce risk by exposing attacker behavior early.

If it’s online, it’s already being profiled.
